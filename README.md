### The Universal Kaggle Gateway for Data Scientists


KaggleEase is a minimalist, high-performance Python library designed to bridge the gap between Kaggle's vast data ecosystem and your local or Colab development environment. It replaces the heavy official Kaggle package with a smart, self-healing REST client that "just works."

# KaggleEase vs. KaggleHub: The Professional Choice 🚀

**KaggleHub** is the official engine; **KaggleEase** is the intelligent autopilot. 
KaggleEase builds *on top* of KaggleHub, automating the tedious "glue code" Data Scientists write every day.

| Feature | 🐢 KaggleHub (The Engine) | 🚀 KaggleEase (The Solution) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Core Function** | Downloads files to disk. | Downloads **AND** loads them into memory. |
| **Output Type** | Returns a `str` path (e.g., `/root/.cache/...`). | Returns a `pd.DataFrame` (Ready for analysis). |
| **Code Required** | 3-5 lines per dataset (Import `os`, find file, `read_csv`). | **1 line total.** (`df = load("dataset")`). |
| **Smart Loading** | ❌ None. You must know the file format. | ✅ **Universal.** Auto-detects CSV, Excel, JSON, Parquet, SQLite. |
| **Error Handling** | ❌ Crashes on typos or wrong slugs. | ✅ **Self-Healing.** Auto-corrects typos & finds obscured files. |
| **Competition Support** | Separate API (`competition_download`). | ✅ **Unified.** Automatic detection via the same [load()] command. |
| **Notebook Speed** | Standard Python. | ✅ **Turbo Mode.** IPyhon Magics: `%kaggle load titanic`. |

### 💡 The Verdict
*   **Use KaggleHub** when you are building a custom pipeline and need raw file access with zero abstraction.
*   **Use KaggleEase** when you are a Data Scientist who values time and wants to go from "Idea" to "Dataframe" in 5 seconds.

## 🌟 Top Features

| Feature | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🚀 Universal Load** | Handles CSV, Parquet, JSON, Excel, and SQLite automatically. |
| **🏆 Native Competitions** | Official competition slugs (like `titanic`) work out of the box. |
| **🛡️ No-Crash Fallback** | Returns local path strings for non-tabular data (Images/Models). |
| **🧠 Deep Intelligence** | Fuzzy handle matching, implicit resolution, and self-healing APIs. |
| **✨ IPython Magics** | Use `%kaggle_load` for zero-boilerplate loading in notebooks. |

## ⚡ Quick Start

### 1. Installation
```python
!pip install kaggleease --upgrade
```

### 2. Authentication (Foolproof)
You can set environment variables (safest) or use `kaggle.json`.
```python
import os
os.environ['KAGGLE_USERNAME'] = "your_username"
os.environ['KAGGLE_KEY'] = "your_api_key"
```

### 3. Load Anything
```python
from kaggleease import load

# Loaded as a Pandas DataFrame automatically
df = load("titanic") 

# Images? Returns the local path string
path = load("resnet50")
```

---

## 🛠️ Advanced Usage

### Universal Formats
```python
# Load JSON
df = load("rtatman/iris-dataset-json-version")

# Load SQLite (Auto-detects the first table!)
df = load("world-bank/world-development-indicators")
```

### Deep-Scan Intelligence
If a dataset has an obscured API (like `heptapod/titanic`), KaggleEase bypassed the error, downloads the data, and scans every subdirectory to find your CSV for you.
